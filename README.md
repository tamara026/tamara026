**Aspiring QA Specialist**

## About Me üåü

Hey, my name is Tamara! Since the beginning of 2024 I have been studying and practicing to become a QA specialist. I am happy to have finally found an area in which I can successfully develop myself and continuously learn new things. As someone passionate about technology, it's important to me to contribute a process of making software more convenient and intuitive for the user. In the QA position I see the potential to be a part of exciting projects and meet industry professionals. In this portfolio, I would like to share my knowledge of QA and showcase my practical skills that I have gained through courses, self-study and my job. I am determined to continue to grow in this field. In the future, I would like to learn test automation and try new tools.

## My Experience üè¢

Being a junior software tester at CityHome is my first professional position in the QA industry. I have made a significant growth both in my tech and soft skills, such as strong analytical thinking and developped some skills in manual testing. In addition, in my previous job, one of my responsibilities was to oversee the correct operation of the internal system and report any bugs or defects to the administrators. I have grown very fond of this role, which has also made me interested in the QA path. My previous experience in sales and customer support, although unrelated to the IT world, has allowed me to develop valuable soft skills such as teamwork and communication.
